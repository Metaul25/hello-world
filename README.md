# hello-world
First repository in my Github's journey!
Hola mundo!
My name is Raul, I'm an Industrial Engineer from Peru. Since I was a little kid I always liked technology and computers, but for some reason I got lost in the way
and decided not to pursue a carrer in Computer Science or alike, despite this I'm convinced is never too late to learn and develop new abbilities, so here I am!
